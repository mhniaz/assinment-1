            <p id="paragraph">Financial issues prevented Barcelona from spending big to sign players in last summer's
                transfer window, but the Blaugrana are already having a look at who they could bring to the Camp Nou in
                January and next summer.

                Barcelona have looked better in the last couple of games following the arrival of Xavi Hernandez, who
                replaced Ronald Koeman after he was sacked by the club.</p>
